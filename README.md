# Scrabble Word Finder + Word Autocomplete

A quick project playing around with trees (tries) and large dictionaries/word lists.

## Running the Script

Start by choosing a dictionary/word list file (see "words.txt").

For word finder (prints all possible words, given a set of "Scrabble tiles"): type the individual letters.

For autocomplete (prints all words that have a given prefix): type prefix and end the input with an underscore (_).
